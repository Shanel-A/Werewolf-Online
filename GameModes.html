Talismans and viewing other players stats are disabled here. Ranks are measured in Skill. After playing a game, the rank is calculated based on the role you had and the rank of other players. If the players you beat are higher rank, you will receive more than skill than if the players you beat are of a lower rank. If you lose, you lose more skill if you are beaten by lower rank players. Currently you have to pay 5 gold to enter a ranked game. It was implemented to reduce suicides and make winning more important.</p>

	<li> <b> Custom </b> </li> 
	<p> - Choose the roles and even change some settings! A great way to maximize the fun level! Creating a custom game costs 2000 coins or 680 diamonds. On purchase, the player also unlocks a special outfit and receives 25 Roses. Buying custom games is a one time purchase only, meaning it won't cost anything to host a lobby after purchase.

Players can join lobbies in this game mode for free. Additional roles can be bought for roses or coins. Players who bought custom games can host a game with any of the roles they have. They can choose to let any other player join their game or restrict their lobby by setting it to private, putting a password or player level requirements. The host can also kick other players from their lobby.

Talismans can either be enabled or disabled, and roles can be hidden on death. Gameplay settings also allow the host to change the time length for night, day, and voting stage, from 1 second to 120 seconds. Settings also allow players to enable voice mode if they want.

The host can start their game anytime they want. If the lobby has been filled with 16 players, it will automatically start. </p>

If you enable Invites for everybody, you allow your friends to invite their friends too. You can not play ranked with friends but sandbox is open. </p>
