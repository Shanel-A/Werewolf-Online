	<h2> <b> Gameplay </b> </h2>
<!--Paragraph 14-->
	<p> The game Werewolf Online has been compared to Mafia and Town of Salem. It has the same type of gameplay with a twist. In Mafia, you have two teams battling to win. In <abbr title="Werewolf Online">WWO</abbr> you have several roles villagers, werewolves, solo roles, and killer roles all vying to win. Available on Android and iOS.
<abbr title="Werewolf Online">WWO</abbr> has 6 game modes such as Quick game/Classic, Sandbox, Ranked, Custom, Play with Friends, and Spectator. A game can be played by up to 16 players. 3 teams will compete namely: Villagers, Werewolves, and Solos. Villagers have seers to look up roles at night as Werewolves have Wolf Seers with the same ability. The Seer/Aura Seer/Spirit Seer will give the info during the day in the discussion period while the Wolf Seer will do the same at night for the werewolves. For villagers to win they must get rid of the opposing teams and likewise for the other teams. There is also Cupid and their couple. For couple to win they must be the last 2 remaining alive with or without Cupid. Headhunter and Fool are solo roles. Headhunter will try to convince you that their target should be voted by the other players, their target cannot be shot or killed at night, Headhunter can only win with a vote. If the Headhunter's target dies by other means he becomes part of the villagers’ team for the rest of the game. Fool can only win by being voted off. The Sect and Zombie will win if they kill all the other evil teams and turn villagers into sect or zombie. Arsonist, Serial Killer, Cannibal, Bomber are solo killers and will have to kill all other players to win. Bandit starts off alone like the Sect Leader and Zombie. All 3 cannot turn the opposing evil teams’ members. When a bandit tries to turn a werewolf, the werewolf dies. Before the game starts your role is chosen through a random spinning wheel. If you have a role that you enjoy playing you can get talismans that up your chances of getting that role (will not apply to rank and some custom games). You can get talismans from loot boxes, battles pass, or purchase in the inventory section. You can also upgrade your talisman to receive a better chance. </p>
