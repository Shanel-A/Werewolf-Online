	<!--Paragraph 54-->
	<p> - At night, the Bandit finds an Accomplice by converting another player. Then each night, the Bandit and the Accomplice can select a player to kill.

If they vote different players, then the deciding vote will be the Accomplice's vote.

The Bandit cannot be killed by the werewolves.

Only villagers and random voting roles can be converted to Accomplice. Trying to convert a werewolf will result in the Bandit killing that werewolf, unlike Zombie or Sect Leader, who simply fail to convert. Headhunter's target cannot be converted while the Headhunter is alive. Players who are being protected by a Protector role cannot be converted as long as they're being protected.

If the Accomplice dies, the Bandit can select a new Accomplice next night.

Only the first Accomplice can kill without Bandit. Later Accomplices cannot kill if Bandit is dead. For example, if the first Accomplice dies and Bandit makes a new Accomplice, then Bandit dies, the new Accomplice will not be able to kill anyone at night. </p>

	<!--Paragraph 55-->
	<p> - At night, the Bomber can place a bomb which will kill a maximum of 3 players. This bomb can be rotated to kill different players (horizontally, vertically and diagonally). The following night, the bomb explodes, killing the selected players. The night after that, the bomber can place a new bomb. This process of placing a bomb every two nights continues until the bomber dies. The Bomber cannot be killed by the Werewolves. Even if it looks like the bomb is placed on yourself you won't die. The bomb does not explode if the Bomber is killed during the daytime, but it will if they are killed during the nighttime. The bomber can be converted into a zombie. If the bomber dies during the night of explosion, the bomb will still explode. </p>

	<p> - Each night the Corruptor can select one player to 'glitch'. That player will not be able to speak, vote or send emojis the following day and will die after the voting. That player's role will not be revealed when they die. Instead, it will be replaced by a question mark.

When a person is corrupted, they will receive a message. A "glitchy person" icon will also show in the middle of the screen. </p>

	<p> - Each night the Cannibal can choose to eat one player. They can also choose to wait several nights and then eat five players at once.

Each night you gain 1 "skull" icon which can be used to kill people, so for 4 days without eating you can get 5 "skull" icons to be used to kill people on the fifth night. </p>

	<p> - Each night, the Sect Leader can select one player to convert to their team, known as the Sect. This player must be from the village team, or be a voting role, otherwise they will not be converted. Unturned Cursed and President do not count. If the Sect Leader dies, every converted player commits suicide. The Sect leader cannot convert the Cursed, President and Zombie. </p>

	<p> - The Illusionist can disguise people every night. Disguised people will appear to be illusionists to seers. He can also kill all disguised people during the day. The Illusionist cannot be killed by Werewolves. When a disguised target is checked by Aura Seer, it will show as unknown.
It's hard for Illusionist to win in 1v1 against a villager role. As the villager can skip discussing time, while the illusionist can only kill during the discussion time. If this happens 3 days in a row, it will result in a tie. </p>
